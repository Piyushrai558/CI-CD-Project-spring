# CI-CD-Project-spring
This is repository is used to supply repo to aws elastic beakstalk in order to setup a Continous Integration and continous deployment 

As soon as someone pushed a new code A pipeline triggered in Aws code pipeline.

I have specified the buildspec.yml file in gir repository where in script it is written the build command.

Beanstalker is used for deployment where this repository is specified to read src code.

This is Just a demo project to learn the CI/CD with aws beanstalker.
